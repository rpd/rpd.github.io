GitHub really bamboozles me. I have been a member since 2009 and rarely use it as my repositories are simple and not popular or well used by myself or others. My confusion with GitHub centres around the fact that I do not use it much.
Simply if you use a tool regularly then you may become good with it's use and if you do not use it regularly then you will not understand and use it well and this is the category I am in. 

However although I have not used it much since I joined it has been useful to use even for the small amounts I have used it for. Today I am looking at this root web page site. I have another page @ <a href="http://rpd.github.io/rhd_DEgs/" target="_blank">rpd.github.io/rhd_DEgs</a>
